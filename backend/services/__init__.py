"""Business rules: budgets, model access, anomaly evaluation, assistant orchestration.

This is where a decision gets made rather than stored or transported. Services raise
`HTTPException` for outcomes the caller must see, which keeps the route layer thin at the
cost of a FastAPI import here -- a deliberate trade, since every caller is HTTP today.

May import `domain`, `persistence`, `integrations` and `config`. Must not import `api`.
