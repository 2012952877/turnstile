/** Local development only: move the whole page to `localhost` before anything else runs.

 *  Entra compares redirect URIs as exact strings and does not treat `127.0.0.1` and
 *  `localhost` as the same host, so opening the app on the wrong one fails the Microsoft
 *  sign-in with AADSTS50011. Registering both addresses would also work, but that is a
 *  portal change every developer has to know about, and forgetting it produces an error
 *  that says nothing about which of the two you happened to type.
 *
 *  It has to be a full navigation rather than just overriding MSAL's redirectUri: the PKCE
 *  verifier and the state MSAL writes before leaving live in this origin's sessionStorage,
 *  so coming back on a different origin would leave them unreadable and fail anyway.
 *  Doing it here, before `createRoot`, means nothing has been fetched or stored yet.
 *
 *  `replace` rather than `assign` so the back button does not bounce between the two. */

 *  anonymous caller, so the gate has to sit above `App`, not inside it.
 *
 *  `checking` used to render nothing, on the reasoning that it lasts one tick. That was
 *  true only for the plain case. Returning from Microsoft it covers MSAL initialising, the
 *  redirect being processed, a round trip to exchange the token and the server fetching
 *  Microsoft's signing keys -- measured at about five seconds of blank page, which reads
